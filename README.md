# motif-finding

For serial portion of the report:
- can change data type of PWM to float, double, long double
- run correctness tests
- try out differennt convergence criteria (how long to reach X% correct)
- do basic profiling of where the code spends time
- timing as a function of number of motifs included in sequences
- as a function of motif length

For MPI:
- convergence
- scaling studies
